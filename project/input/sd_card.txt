Desert Rose, Sting, 4.43, I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand
It`s My Life, Bon Jovi, 4.26, It's my life It's now or never But I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive
Midnight Sky, Miley Cyrus, 3.42, The midnight sky is the road I'm takin' Head high up in the clouds Oh
Light, Jerome, 2.47, You could be the light that shines tonight I let you lead the way to paradise
